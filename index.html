    <p class="paragraph">My brother's name is Chris Olmassakian. He is a student at University of California, Davis. He is studying computer programming. He thinks he is a genius and better than the rest of the world because he thinks real sciences are the only subjects worth learning.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">His sister, Lori, is a very sweet girl. She wanted to impress her brother so she decided to learn how to code. She is very new to it so she is not very good yet.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Lori decided to tell her brother about her new skills. He was not impressed, and he hurt her feelngs with his cold and sarcastic tone. This is her new attempt to blow his socks off.</p>
    <h3 class="list">Even though Chris can be a jerk, Lori loves him because:</h3>
        <ol class="list">

            <li>They have the same dark humor.</li>
            <li>He helps her with her computer problems sometimes.</li>
        </ol>
